# QuickMarks

[QuickMarks](https://quickmetrics.herokuapp.com) is an analytics app for web projects. It helps you track events on your websites. It is built using Rails, Devise, and a few charting libraries.

Quickmarks analytics offers a few key features:  
- A client-side JavaScript snippet that allows a user to track events on their website  
- A server-side API that captures and saves those events to a database  
- A Rails application that displays the captured event data for a user  

## Installation

Here's how you track your website with Quickmarks:

Follow readme steps in https://github.com/mkolenda/priviametrics
Step 1: Include loading of the JS file in the app's HTML header

```
<head>
  <script src="//quickmetrics.herokuapp.com/assets/quickmetrics.js"></script>
  ...other tags...
</head>
```

Step 2: call quickmetrics function in app
Add custom code for linl tracking from [lunametrics]( http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2013/07/02/jquery-event-tracking-generator-google-analytics/)

```
// Generated by LunaMetrics at http://buff.ly/12bFTwk
// Place Google Analytics tracking code here, or in a .js file

$(document).ready(function() {

	$("a").each(function() {
		var href = $(this).attr("href");
		var target = $(this).attr("target");
		var text = $(this).text();
		$(this).click(function(event) { // when someone clicks these links
			event.preventDefault(); // don't open the link yet
			_gaq.push(["_trackPageview", href]); // create a dynamic pageview
			setTimeout(function() { // now wait 300 milliseconds...
				window.open(href,(!target?"_self":target)); // ...and open the link as usual
			},300);
		});
	});

});
```
